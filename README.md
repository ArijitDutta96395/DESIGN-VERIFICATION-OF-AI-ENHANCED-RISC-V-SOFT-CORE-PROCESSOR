# AI-Accelerated RISC-V Soft-Core Processor 🤖⚡

> **Simulation-First Design and Verification of Custom AI Datapaths** 🧪

## Overview 📝

This project integrates domain-specific AI acceleration units into a minimal RISC-V soft-core processor, enabling efficient inference workloads through custom instructions for MAC, ReLU, convolution, FIR filtering, and pooling operations while maintaining full RV32I ISA compatibility.

Our simulation-first methodology enables rapid prototyping and verification of hardware accelerators before physical implementation, significantly reducing development cycles and costs while ensuring correctness and performance guarantees.
